## Instruction on how to set up neo4j

The app itself is launched as a normal Angular app, the instructions are already given. Once the app is built in the folder [src/environments/neo4j.ts] there is a constant [credentials] where the neo4j credentiants are put. For the sake of this project as it is a college asignment it is hardcoded.
